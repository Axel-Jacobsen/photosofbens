		<h1> FAQ </h1> 

		<div class="ben-zone" style="align-items: left">
			<p>
			<b> Why is it "Photos of Ben" instead of "Photos of Bens", if there are multiple Bens on the website? </b> <br>
			That question is not allowed.
			<br>
			<br>

			<b> What is the "Ben Standard"? </b> <br>
			The Ben Standard is the basic naming standard for this website. It is both strict and forgiving. Legal names including "Ben" or "Benjamin" are of course acceptable. Nick-names are also accepted, since the law is just a construct. If you feel you are named Ben, and people will call you Ben, you are a Ben. Unacceptable submissions include beings not named Ben.
			<br>
			<br>

			<b> What is the number 1 Rule of <a href=../index.html>photosofben.com</a>? </b> <br>
			The number 1 Rule is that Bens are number 1. This is a place to appreciate our Bens. Bens have the power here. If you are a Ben, or want your Ben removed, please send an email to <a href="mailto:info@photosofben.com">info@photosofben.com</a> and it will be removed as soon as I see the email.

			<br>
			<br>

			<b> What is Rule 2 of <a href=../index.html>photosofben.com</a>? </b> <br>
			It must be a Ben that has been or currently is alive. Examples of rejected "Bens" include a picture of a Mercedes-Benz (an attempt at a pun) and a picture of Ben from <a href="https://www.unclebens.ca/products">Uncle Ben's Rice</a> (Ben must be alive). See more rejected submissions <a href=rejects.html>here</a>.

			<br>
			<br>

			<b> What is Rule 3 of <a href=../>photosofben.com</a>? </b> </br>
			No famous Bens. It is too easy.

			<br>
			<br>

			<b> What is the exception to Rule 3?? </b> </br>
			You must know the Ben personally. Although I hate to ask, providing some sort of proof would improve the probability of your Ben being accepted.
			<br>
			<br>

			<b> What is Rule 4 of <a href=../>photosofben.com</a>? </b> </br>
			No resubmitting Bens. We may be able to support multiple photographs of the same Ben in the future, but until then, each Ben submission must be a Ben that we have not seen before.
			<br>
			<br>

			<b> What is Rule 5 of  <a href=../>photosofben.com</a>? </b> </br>
			Any Ben that gets accepted to the website gets a beer on me (Benevolent Leader of  <a href=../>photosofben.com</a>). Must be in person. The Ben must ask (verbatim): "Dear Benevolent Leader, may I redeem my Ben Beer?", to which I shall respond by kissing them on the forhead and stating "well of course, my sweet little Ben, of course, don't you fret for one more second! Your Ben Beer shall be kissing your lips just as I have kissed your forhead now!". They then get their Ben Beer.
			<br>
			<br>

			<b> What is Rule 6 of  <a href=../>photosofben.com</a>? </b> </br>
			No Minors.
