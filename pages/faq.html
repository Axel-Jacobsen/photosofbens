		<h1> FAQ </h1> 

		<div class="ben-zone" style="align-items: left">
			<p>
			<b> Why is it "photos of ben" instead of "photos of bens", if there are multiple Bens on the website? </b> <br>
			That question is not allowed.
			<br>
			<br>

			<b> What is the "Ben Standard"? </b> <br>
			The Ben Standard is both strict, and forgiving. Legal names including "Ben" or "Benjamin" are of course acceptable. Nick names are also accepted, since the law is just a construct.
			<br>
			<br>

			<b> What is the number 1 rule of <a href=photosofben.com>photosofben.com</a>? </b> <br>
			The number 1 rule is that Bens are number 1. This is a place to appreciate our Bens. Bens have the power here. If you are a Ben, or want your Ben removed, please send an email to <a href="mailto:info@photosofben.com">info@photosofben.com</a> and it will be removed as soon as I see the email.
